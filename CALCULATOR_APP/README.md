# CUSTOMISED CALCULATOR

This project is a simple calculator, created as part of my practise how to code after graduating Software Engineering from ALX Africa. It demonstrates fundamental arithmetic operations alongside additional advanced functionalities, showcasing my growth in frontend development.


## **Description**:
 Calculator with basic arithmetic operation functionalities like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Design a user-friendly interface with buttons for data entry and a display screen for showing results. This task enhances essential knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project's Features
1. **Basic Arithmetic**:
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **Advanced Functionalities**:
   - Percentage calculation.
   - Square root computation.
   - Exponentiation (e.g., powers and squares).
   - Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).
   - Logarithmic calculations (natural and base-10)

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensures usability across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and branding the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing all calculator functionalities.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the files on a linux Machine.
2. Place all files in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view and interact with the calculator.

## File Structure
